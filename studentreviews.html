    <h1>Gowtham GM</h1>
    <p>A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.<br>
        I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. I joined Tap <br>
        Academy as a CSR student in the month of February. My journey with Tap<br> 
        Academy is quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and <br>
        experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in learning 
        <br>programming languages from scratch.<br>
        
        I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap Academy<br>
         is structured in a way that makes it easy for students from all domains to<br> 
         understand the concepts and technology taught by the trainers.
        
        Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of <br>
        3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job.
        
        Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this <br>
        opportunity.</p>

            Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving skills.<br>
             Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all the recorded videos.<br>
              They also provide recorded videos of frameworks like J2EE, Spring, Data<br>
               Structures, etc.<br>

             Technical Consultant with a package of 3 LPA.<br>
